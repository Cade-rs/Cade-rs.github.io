# Calendar

Currently making sure the calendar embed won't break github pages.

You can place plain old html in here, like this:

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=cader.stephenson%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Chicago" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>



* You can use markdown formatting here just fine.
* This is a list

1. This is an ordered List
2. This is the next item

## This heading is slightly smaller.

To check markdown examples, check the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

You can even create tables pretty easily:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
